# Solution to problem 4

Some examples of questions I might start by asking are:

+ *What are they seeking to learn?* (i.e. what is the purpose behind the study.) For example, they may have a list of questions they're seeking to explore or a hypothesis they want to test. This will inform what data is collected and how it is analysed and reported, as well as ethical considerations.
+ *Have they received ethical approval for this study? Has it been established whether or not informed consent would be required from any individuals?* A proper ethical review is important since the research is of a sensitive nature concerning individuals and overseas politics. Here we might refer to ethical guidelines (e.g. [[Goldsworth, 2020](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-protection/sites/data-protection/files/using-twitter-research-v1.0.pdf)][Hemphill et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01773-w).
+ *Who are the group of people?* For example, are they a handful of individual users or a demographic group. This would help us to get a sense of the amount of data they're seeking to collect and the costs that might be involved.
+ *How much time and budget do they have for this project?* This would inform methods and tooling.
+ *Who are the other stakeholders on this project?* *What are their needs with respect to this analysis?* For example, maybe they have outside collaborators who need access to raw data or analytics. This will influence the choice of technical solution.
+ *What sort of help or guidance are they looking for from us?* For example, are they looking for support to collect and analyse the data themselves, or do they want us to produce something like an analytics dashboard. If it's closer to the former, I'd want to find out what data science skills and capabilities they already have as this will help to inform the collaborative approach.
